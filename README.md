# express-sessions-base

A base repo with `express-session` already set up and connections to multiple databases available for you to fork.
Connections to databases can be found in branches named `connect-to-*` with the database name at the end. eg. `connect-to-firebase`, `connect-to-redis`, etc. If you want a generic `express-session` implementation connected to no databases for development purposes, then the `master` branch is what you need.
